I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Queen's University Belfast, under the supervision of Professor [Qiuwei Wu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/2022/0224/c4998a55905/page.htm), with co-supervision from Dr. [Shuyan Li](https://shuyan98.github.io/). My doctoral research is focused on AI-enabled optimal operation of net-zero power and energy systems, aiming to develop sustainable and efficient solutions for future energy infrastructures.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science & Technology from CUMT. I then served as the Chief Technology Officer at Beijing Meishicha Technology Co., Ltd., where I led the development of cutting-edge AI-driven products. My work spans across various domains, including healthcare, legal technology, and real-time recognition systems, demonstrating a consistent track record of innovation and technical excellence. Additionally, I have achieved significant recognition in the field, winning several hackathons and Kaggle competitions.

My research interests include the application of AI and machine learning in energy systems, advanced algorithm development, and real-time data processing. I am passionate about contributing to the AI community and exploring new frontiers in technology.
