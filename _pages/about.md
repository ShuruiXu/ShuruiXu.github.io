I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Queen's University Belfast, under the supervision of Professor [Qiuwei Wu](https://www.tbsi.edu.cn/english/2022/0224/c4998a55905/page.htm), with co-supervision from Dr. [Shuyan Li](https://shuyan98.github.io/). My doctoral research is focused on AI-enabled optimal operation of net-zero power and energy systems, aiming to develop sustainable and efficient solutions for future energy infrastructures.

Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Science & Technology from CUMT. I then served as the Chief Technology Officer at Beijing Meishicha Technology Co., Ltd., where I led the development of cutting-edge AI-driven products. 

My work spans across various domains, including healthcare, legal technology, and real-time recognition systems, demonstrating a consistent track record of innovation and technical excellence. Additionally, I have achieved significant recognition in the field, winning several hackathons and Kaggle competitions.

I broadly interested in Computer Vision & AI4E：
 - Unsupervised Multimodal Representation Hashing
 - Medical Image Processing
 - LLM for Power System
